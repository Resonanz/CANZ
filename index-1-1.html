Ps 19:1-4). This paper provides an example of how God reveals Himself through both books of revelation, and how they complement one another.<br></p><h3>The Volume of the Creatures</h3><p class="text-start text-light">Present among the humus layers on the forest floors of New Zealand's indigenous forests, is a tiny "worm like" creature belonging to the genus Peripatus. It is called a "living fossil," for the phylum (or larger classification unit) to which it belongs, has remained virtually unchanged since the Cambrian period, some 600 million years ago (based on the evolutionary time scale). In other words, species very similar to those existing today, can be found as fossils in the oldest rock layers which contain the first fossils of multicellular organisms. Peripatus like creatures from the Cambrian appear fully functional and fully differentiated in terms of their complex anatomical features, and no intermediate forms leading up to them have been found in earlier rock strata.<br></p><p class="text-start text-light">Organisms like Peripatus share a number of features with both worms (Phylum Annelida) and arthropods (Phylum Arthropoda. includes insects), and so have been described as the "missing link" between these two phyla, However, they possess a number of unique features and so are classified in a separate phylum&nbsp;Onychophora. They are not really "missing links," since there is no evidence that the origin of true worms or arthropods is linked to this phylum. Onychophora have been so highly specialised from the time they first appear in the fossil record, that they could not have been a generalised "intermediate form" which gave rise to new phyla<sup>1</sup>.<br></p><p class="text-start text-light">Diagrams below of Onychophora show that it is a highly complex organism. The design features present could not have evolved by a trial and error mechanism of natural selection operating on chance mutations. Such a 'mechanism' is central to the Neo Darwinian explanation for the origin of biological diversity in the world today. Figures 1 and 2 below show the reproductive system of a common earthworm.<br></p><figure class="figure"><img class="img-fluid figure-img" src="assets/img/sacf/sacffig1.png" loading="lazy" alt="Reproductive System of an Earthworm (Onychophora)"><figcaption class="figure-caption">Fig. 1: Reproductive System of an Earthworm (Onychophora).</figcaption></figure><figure class="figure"><img class="img-fluid figure-img" src="assets/img/sacf/sacffig2.png" loading="lazy" alt="Reproductive System of an Earthworm (Onychophora)"><figcaption class="figure-caption">Fig. 2: Reproductive System of an Earthworm (Onychophora)</figcaption></figure><p class="text-start text-light">Figures 3 and 4 show the internal structure of an onychophoran revealing the presence of an ovary containing eggs, and a uterus. Only in the Australian onychophoran genera are females armed with an ovipositor, enabling them to lay their large yolky eggs enclosed in a chitinous shell, in moist situations outside the body. Many other species are viviparous, meaning that the establishment of a placenta permits a longer period of development in the uterus of the mother, so that the young are born in a very advanced stage. Uterine secretions provide for the nutrition of the embryo, and the nutritive material is obtained by the embryo through a special embryonic membrane or through a "placental" connection to the uterine wall. In this respect they are highly advanced<sup>2</sup>. The most highly evolved Mammals are considered to be the Placentals (eg. bats, whales, dolphins, porpoises, seals, mam etc.). And yet the lowly Onychophora appear to have possessed a placenta hundreds of millions of years before the mammals arose (according to the evolutionary time scale).</p><figure class="figure"><img class="img-fluid figure-img" src="assets/img/sacf/sacffig3.png" loading="lazy" alt="Internal Organs of an Earthworm (Onychophora)"><figcaption class="figure-caption">Fig. 3:&nbsp;Internal Organs of an Earthworm (Onychophora)</figcaption></figure><figure class="figure"><img class="img-fluid figure-img" src="assets/img/sacf/sacffig4.png" loading="lazy" alt="Internal Organs of an Earthworm (Onychophora)"><figcaption class="figure-caption">Fig. 4:&nbsp;Internal Organs of an Earthworm (Onychophora)</figcaption></figure><p class="text-start text-light">Worms and lowly "Worm like" creatures like Onychophora are masterpieces of engineering design. The female reproductive systems of Onychophora alone incorporate all three methods of egg development found in the higher animals. The circulatory system is similar to that of arthropods (including the insects) and blood is propelled forward by a tubular dorsal heart. Like worms, Onychophorans move by extension and contraction of the body, except that the body is raised off the ground by logs. Waves of contraction, affecting both sides of the body simultaneously and only a few segments at a time, progress from the anterior to the posterior. When the segment is extended the legs are lifted from the ground and moved forward. The ingenuity of design evident in the organ systems of this creature, points to a Designer. The genetic programming which codes for all these design features, and ensures their transfer from one generation to the next is truly a marvel.<br></p><p class="text-start text-light">In Romans, the apostle Paul wrote: "that which is known about God is evident within them [the unrighteous], for God made it evident to them. For since the creation of the world His [God's] invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they [the unrighteous] are without excuse" [for rejecting God]. When examined, the biological world is found to reveal overwhelming evidence of God's eternal power as Creator. The plan and purpose in biology is self evident. It proclaims the glory of God. However, those intent on suppressing the knowledge of God (see Rom 1:18), insist that nature itself should be credited as the source of biological design. Naturalistic science excludes by definition even the possibility of a supernatural First Cause of the rationality, causality, and unity of the universe.<br></p><h1 class="text-start text-light">The Definition of Science</h1><p class="text-start text-light">The word 'science' (from the Latin scientia, from scio, to know), was originally defined and intended to mean "truth" or "facts" or "knowledge". It meant in a general sense, knowledge, or certain knowledge; the comprehension or understanding of truth or facts by the mind. Thus the 'science' of God was sew to be perfect. The essence of the scientific method has until now been claimed to be observation, experimentation, falsifiability, and repeatability. However, scientific thought soon parted from theology because it excluded the idea of an agent of 'Force' outside of or beyond natural measurable forces. Modern science is presented as neutral to the idea of the supernatural. This is fine when it comes to the empirical sciences which methodologically exclude the supernatural. If they did not, the very idea of testability and repeatability could not work. However, the notion of a First Cause is also excluded from those areas of modern science which fall outside the definition of the empirical sciences. For example, the science of origins which involves speculations and hypotheses about the origin of the first life forms and the universe, is not open to testing, and yet it excludes the very idea of a Creator a priori. Such an assumption is purely arbitrary.<br></p><p class="text-start text-light">Modern science is dominated by naturalistic philosophy. There is an implicit faith commitment to the dogma that the universe contains within itself the factors responsible for its own self evolution and progress towards higher and higher levels of consciousness. Scientists committed to this faith system forget that the very birth of modern science owes its very existence to Christianity<sup>3</sup>.</p><h1 class="text-start text-light">The Biblical Basis for the Presuppositions of Modem Science</h1><p class="text-start text-light">The biblical world view provided all the main presuppositions or premises upon which modem science is founded. Without the Bible as a source of revelation about the nature of reality, modem scientists have little, if any basis for believing any one of these premises which include:<br></p><ol><li>The universe exists</li><li>The universe is ordered</li><li>The universe is understandable</li><li>Our senses are reliable</li><li>The "law" of cause and effect operates</li><li>Natural law and processes are uniform through all space</li><li>Natural law and processes are uniform through all time</li><li>All natural law is ultimately unifiable</li></ol><p class="text-start text-light">Let us briefly examine each of these premises.<br></p><h1 class="text-start text-light">(1) The universe exists</h1><p class="text-start text-light">xxx</p><p class="text-start text-light">xxx</p><p class="text-start text-light">xxx</p><p class="text-start text-light">xxx</p><p class="text-start text-light">xxx</p><p class="text-start text-light">xxx</p><p class="text-start text-light">xxx</p><p class="text-start text-light">xxx</p><p class="text-start text-light">xxx</p><p class="text-start text-light">xxx</p><p class="text-start text-light">xxx</p><h1 class="text-start text-light">References</h1><p class="text-start text-light">1.
